The core Phosphor widget class.

[API Docs](http://phosphorjs.github.io/phosphor-widget/api/)

Phosphor widgets provide several useful behaviours:

- **Widget Hierarchy** - A widget is a JS object which wraps a DOM node and
  establishes a live parent-child relationship. While this may seem trivial,
  it allows for the implementation of advanced message passing and notification
  behaviors, and provides a sane pattern for component reuse.

- **Messages** - Standard messages include show/hide, attach/detach, resize,
  and close, to name just a few. Desktop GUI toolkits have had these for ages,
  but they are missing from the DOM. These sorts of messages are critical for
  creating a desktop-like experience in the browser. Users can also define
  their own custom messages to support advanced behavior.

- **Unopinionated Design** - *Any* DOM content can be added to a widget.
  [Examples](https://phosphorjs.github.io/examples.html) exist for React
  and others, but the `node` attribute of a `Widget` is just a standard
  DOM node, so content generated by nearly any framework can be hosted
  by a widget.

Usage Examples
--------------

**Note:** This module is fully compatible with Node/Babel/ES6/ES5. Simply
omit the type declarations when using a language other than TypeScript.

A `Widget` is the base class of the phosphor widget hierarchy. A `Widget` has
a `node` property, which is a standard DOM node. For simple UIs or for custom
generated content, the content nodes can be added directly to a widget's node:

```typescript
import {
  Widget
} from 'phosphor-widget';

let widget = new Widget();
let div = document.createElement('div');
widget.node.appendChild(div);
```

A `Widget` also inherits from
[NodeWrapper](https://github.com/phosphorjs/phosphor-nodewrapper),
which means setting the node id and toggling CSS classes is simple:

```typescript
let widget = new Widget();
widget.id = 'main';
widget.addClass('foo');
widget.addClass('bar');
widget.removeClass('foo');
widget.toggleClass('bar', false);
```

A widget can be attached to the DOM with the `attach` method, which ensures
that the proper attachment messages are dispatched to the widget hierarchy.

```typescript
let widget = new Widget();
widget.attach(document.body);
```

Likewise, a widget can be detached from the DOM with the `detach` method,
though it is more common to simply `dispose` of the widget.

```typescript
let widget = new Widget();
widget.attach(document.body);

// sometime later...
widget.detach();

// or almost equivalently
widget.dispose();
```

Children can be added to a widget by using a `layout`.

```typescript
import {
  Layout
} from 'phosphor-widget';

class MyCustomLayout extends Layout {
  ...
}

let foo = new Widget();
let bar = new Widget();

let layout = MyCustomLayout();
layout.myAddMethod(foo);
layout.myAddMethod(bar);

let parent = new Widget();
parent.layout = layout;
```

The `Layout` class is a low-level abstract base class which must be subclassed
to be useful. While it provides the greatest level of control and flexibility,
it requires a decent amount of code and a solid understanding of the framework
to use successfully. The `AbstractLayout` class is provided to ease the burden
of writing layouts, but comes with a slight reduction in flexibility. However,
most layouts and container widgets can be built on top of the concrete
[Panel](https://github.com/phosphorjs/phosphor-panel) and
[PanelLayout](https://github.com/phosphorjs/phosphor-panel) classes.

The amount of flexibility offered by the base widget and layout classes allows
a user to create nearly any application using content generated by nearly any
framework. The PhosphorJS project provides several useful widgets, panels, and
layouts out of the box. Some of the more commonly used are:

- [BoxPanel](https://github.com/phosphorjs/phosphor-boxpanel)
- [DockPanel](https://github.com/phosphorjs/phosphor-dockpanel)
- [GridPanel](https://github.com/phosphorjs/phosphor-gridpanel)
- [Menu](https://github.com/phosphorjs/phosphor-menus)
- [MenuBar](https://github.com/phosphorjs/phosphor-menus)
- [Panel](https://github.com/phosphorjs/phosphor-panel)
- [SplitPanel](https://github.com/phosphorjs/phosphor-splitpanel)
- [TabBar](https://github.com/phosphorjs/phosphor-tabs)
- [TabPanel](https://github.com/phosphorjs/phosphor-tabs)
